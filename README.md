# Front End README

## **Proposal (All team members)**

#### - What problem does your app solve?

Children are finicky eaters. Getting them to consume their daily recommended allowances of nutritional foods is often problematic at the early stages of development, during which nutrition is vital for mental and physical health. Our app generates an excitement around mealtimes by rewarding children for finishing their meals.

#### - Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem?

By creating a 1:1 correlation between the child’s actions and the health of their Gigapet, parents are able to get children to participate in a cyclical system of reward that encourages even the fussiest of eaters by tapping into their child’s innate sense of empathy for other “living” things. With our app, parents and children are able to:

###### Introduce a healthy lifestyle:

Most children naturally gravitate toward unhealthy, sugary snacks. By attaching a virtual pet, we’re giving parents a more “organic” way to introduce their children to the concept of health maintenance through proper nutrition.

###### Assemble a mealtime “team”:

This helps children who are especially finicky not to feel _“set upon”_ whenever they’re prompted to eat.
This also allows parents to set time constraints around mealtimes. Children can understand that their GigaPet must eat at regular intervals.

###### Formulate a healthy meal plan:

Parents and children can track the immediate satisfaction and growth of their GigaPet after consuming their meals. Meals that don’t meet the standard for general nutritional value provide less of a boost to their GigaPet, reinforcing goals around healthy eating (e.g., a candy bar might generate half a point on the nutrition scale, whereas an apple might generate 2-3 points).

#### - What is the mission statement?

Children the world over are facing a public health crisis. Childhood obesity rates are in the double digits, reaching as high as 13.5% for children ages 2-5, worldwide. At GigaPet, we pride ourselves on bringing health education to families in a safe, fun and organic way, having children and parents come together as partners in health to fight this global epidemic. The future may be in their hands, but their nutrition is in ours.
Features (All team members)

#### - What features are required for your minimum viable product?

1. An on-boarding process for parents
2. Ability to easily create a food entry (including date, food category of fruit, vegetable, whole grains, meat, dairy, fats and oils, and treats (or whatever else you want)
3. Ability to easily edit / delete a food entry
4. Display page of daily/weekly/monthly food intake based on category.

#### - What features may you wish to put in a future release?

Create an avatar that updates to different phases based on the food intake ( something like happy if fruitIntake>3)
Allow the parent to add multiple children with different eating logs and characters to their account. Ability for a second parent to log in with a different account and have access to the same kids (shared eating logs).
Some simple games for children to play with their Gigapets.

#### - What do the top 3 similar apps do for their users?

#### Feed Twip

- Teaches recommended serving sizes per meal for each category of food, feeding them to an animal

**Android:** http://bit.ly/2NjYZDn
**iOS:** https://apple.co/2NpIDsI

---

#### Feed Them Right

- Swipe-and-cut style to roughly show servings for food categories. Very rough estimates, no numbers.

**YouTube Preview:** http://bit.ly/2ZarWbZ

#### HuePets

- shows animation of pet starting in egg and hatching/growing as you feed it what you eat. Requires camera access to take picture of meal you are eating, but does not actually use the picture data to determine validity (just a fun activity to do). You then select item to feed pet (carrot, strawberry, mushroom, etc) to help it grow. No numbers, and no negative direction for health, meaning you can only select healthy options to give to the virtual pet.
  Some show children the cooking process and attempt to inspire them to be more involved in meal preparation, and show healthier alternatives to their less healthy foods and snacks.

#### Frameworks - Libraries (Front End)

- What 3rd party frameworks/libraries are you considering using? **TBD**
- Do APIs require you to contact its maintainer to gain access? **At present, no.**
- Are you required to pay to use the API? **No, the API is free.**
- Have you considered using Apple Frameworks? (MapKit, Healthkit, ARKit?) **N/A**

#### Target Audience (All Members)

###### - Who is your target audience? Be specific.

Parents of younger children, ages 3-10

###### - What feedback have you gotten from potential users?

“Sounds like a fun activity to motivate” “I would use it with my 2 kids”

###### - Have you validated the problem and your solution with your target audience? How?

Minimally validated by asking questions like “What motivates your kids?” and “How can a virtual pet help motivate your kids to eat more nutritious foods?” “If you had a game where your kid fed a pet the exact foods he/she eats, how would that benefit them?”

Responses have been positive, with a common phrase being (paraphrased) “Right now, anything new, fun, and interactive would help. My kids need help eating healthy”

#### Research (All members)

- Research thoroughly before writing a single line of code. Solidify the features of your app conceptually before implementation. Spend the weekend researching so you can hit the ground running on Monday.
  Prototype Key Feature(s) (All Members)

- This is the “bread and butter” of the app, this is what makes your app yours. Calculate how long it takes to implement these features and triple the time estimated. That way you’ll have plenty of time to finish. It is preferred to drop features and spend more time working on your MVP features if needed.

Accuracy and ease of adding foods makes our app standout and be unique in ensuring kids get immediate and expected feedback according to what they are eating/consuming.
